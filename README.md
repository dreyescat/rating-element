Rating element can use symbols provided by an external source, like:

* `Typicons by Stephen Hutchings - http://typicons.com/`. Check [typicons](http://typicons.com/) for a list of available symbols.

* If you are already using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), then you have a set of [glyphicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) at your disposal.

* Or you can even generate and customize your own set of symbols with [fontello](http://fontello.com/).
